This repository contains serverless implementations of two stateful machine learning algorithms, k-means clustering and logistic regression. 

Two versions have been implemented for both algorithms, one that requires locks for updating the shared state, and another that is lock-free.

In addition, this repository contains validation and evaluation scripts for assessing the correctness and performance of the serverless implementations.
